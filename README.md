# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
This project involves participating in the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster," where the task is to predict survival based on passenger information. The goal is to fit and compare three different learning algorithms, including a linear and a non-linear learner, and select the best model for submission.
